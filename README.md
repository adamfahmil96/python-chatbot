# Python Chatbot Project
In this Python project with source code, I am going to build a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. I use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses. I create this chatbot using NLTK and Keras.
